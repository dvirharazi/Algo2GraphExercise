# Guidelines: random graph Erdos- Renyi model.
Background to the task: Random graphs help analyze complex networks. In a random graph the amounts of nodes and arcs are random variables Defined by a given probabilistic model. In this exercise we will explore features of unintentional random graphs in the Erdesh-Rinia model. In this model the number of nodes in the graph (we will mark it in V) is fixed and given in advance. However, each side between a pair of nodes will appear in the graph In a probability p independent of the other sides, where p - is a parameter of the model.

Purpose of the task:
In this exercise we will implement a function to create random graphs and in addition we will build auxiliary functions that will help to explore features of The graphs. We will examine the following 3 properties of random graphs in a graph with V nodes (V is a large enough):

connectivity- Threshold1 = (lnV / V) :
If Threshold1 < probability then the graph does not connected with high probability, And if Threshold1 > probability then the graph connected at high probability.

graph diameter- Threshold2 = sqrt(2lnV/V) :
if Threshold2 > probability then in high probability the graph diameter is equal to 2. Otherwise the diameter of the graph is greater than 2.

# 3.Isolated node- Threshold3 = (lnV / V) :
If Threshold3 < probability then in high probability there is an isolated node graph And if Threshold3 > probability then in high probability does not exist in the graph of an isolated node.

# Simulations:
In this section we would like to test the properties of random graphs with the help of simulation. For each of the 3,2,1 features:
Choose a list of 10 possible values for probability - so that half arrays probability will be larger than the Threshold and half arrays will be Smaller than it. (For each of the 3 features) 500 random graphs must be drawn for V = 1000 and for each of the probabilities. Total 5000 per feature (count several) Graphs maintain the feature and some do not. It is worth estimating the probability that a trait exists. It is possible to calculate a ratio between the number of graphs that sustain the trait and the quantity The total of the graphs. Results of simulations can be saved in a file - for example a CSV file. The file can be opened Then in EXCEL and build graphs to help summarize work results.
